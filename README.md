# HR-POLICY-FINDER-AGENT
This agent provides 24/7 self-service support for all internal employee questions related to company policies, benefits, and administrative procedures. It processes natural language questions (e.g., "How many sick days do I have?") and retrieves the most accurate, up-to-date answer directly from the Employee Handbook and internal HR knowledge base.
